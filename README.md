traffic-ui-cleaner
==================

traffic-ui-cleaner is tool which helps Flex developers minimise their memory usage by cleaning unneeded views: removing DisplayObjects from their parents, removing data providers from view components, stopping callLater calls, clearing view bindings and watchers, clearing view states and transitions, etc.

It started with the [flex-uicomponent-cleaner-and-gc-initiator](https://code.google.com/p/flex-uicomponent-cleaner-and-gc-initiator/) library, and then it had many additions and improvements over time.
